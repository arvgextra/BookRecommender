### Abstract 

Using Goodreads book data, we created a book recommender that uses sentiment analysis
and KMeans clustering to find similar books over a wide range of variables. Using this, we
calculated a similarity score between a user-given book and titles similar to it using the distance
of centroids within clusters. This algorithm was implemented into a dashboard to display
recommended titles to users in an easy-to-read way.
